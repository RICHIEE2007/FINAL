    My hobby is shopping, travelling, and reading novel. I really love shopping because shopping is important to improve my outfit. Besides that,
     I love travelling very much, because when I go to another places, I'll get new friends. And also get the unforgettable story for myself. And last is reading novel. 
     I love reading book that makes me feel included in the story is presented. In my opinion, the nice book are indicating the feeling well of the writer. <p></p>

    I am the one who has big dream. Always trying for to reach big achivement. But, my <sub>lazyness</sub> always try to destroy my spirit.
     One of my weakness is I am not a person who has confident. I am shy when I want to talk in front of public. <p></p>
      So I decided to show my aspiration trough the words. <p></p>
      My mother is my inspiration. She always give me some directive to face something and give me spirit to look ahead, and always optimist to try to realize my dreams.
       She always say that I am the best. she is my angel. My family are my spirit. The best event in my live is, when I born in this world and be my mother's children. <p></p>
